# CSCI-480-ASSIGNMENT-1

This project implements a simulated CPU for a small instruction-set architecture. Programs are loaded from assembly-like text files, assembled into fixed-length 12-byte instructions, and executed via a fetch–decode–execute loop. Memory access is abstracted through an MMU and physical memory layer. Process management features such as scheduling and priority are stubbed for later assignments.
